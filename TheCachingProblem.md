When dealing with the Sims 4 ImmutableSlotsClass type, you may encounter the Opaquely Hidden Caching Relationship Arrangement Problem (OHCRAP). Some resources are cached for performance and memory reasons and the result is that if file A's ImmutableSlots are the same as file B's ImmutableSlots, changing file A's ImmutableSlots (such as with the standard method of 'clone_with_overrides'), will change file B's ImmutableSlots too. Because they are, in effect, sharing the same resources in memory.

It seems possible to work around this to some extent, provided you can modify an ImmutableSlotsClass that is not cached (say, one from a fresh custom snippet file) to do your injecting to it and then set the existing one to the new one from the snippet file; in effect, forcing it to use a new ImmutableSlotsClass that is not cached, instead of the old one that may be shared across resources. It is advisable to try to do this where possible when working with ImmutableSlotsClass, but may not be straightforward to do. 

TMI was written before I (Triplis) had any awareness of OHCRAP, so it does not anticipate for it at all. That should probably be changed considering the generic design of TMI, opening up the possibility for easy accidental misuse of it in creating new factory variants that relate to ImmutableSlotsClass injection, though it's not necessarily obvious in what way to approach it.
